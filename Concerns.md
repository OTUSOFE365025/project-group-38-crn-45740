| ID | Concern |
| :---------- | :---------: |
| CRN-1 | Establishing an overall initial system structure |
| CRN-2 | AI models can be unpredictable. That is why it is important to have the model go through rigorous training, and appropriate data processing and response postprocessing for the responses to be accurate enough. (linked with R5, R6, RS5, RM4) |
| CRN-3 | Leveraging the teamâ€™s knowledge on AI models, such as training, feature engineering, and prompt manipulation, as well as frontend and backend implementation. (linked to R6, R7, R3, RD2, RM3) |
| CRN-4 | AI models are susceptible to privacy and data leaks; therefore, it is critical to have security filters in place to protect sensitive information. (linked R1, R5, R8  RS8) |
| CRN-5 | Implementing different data sources, such as registrations, LMS, and calendars, can lead to API concerns relating to security, cost, and failure occurrence. (linked R3 RA1, RM4, RD2) |
