## Business case
The AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP) aims to provide students, faculty and administration alike with a new unified platform. The system provides its users with one place for all institutional data such as course schedules, deadlines, announcements, lecture materials, and academic analytics, offering many customization options. These will be accessed through a conversational interface where an AI assistant will deliver context-aware answers. This platform will be a multi-device scalable cloud-based solution to ensure constant availability so users never experience downtime. Data security and privacy is a top priority giving users a stress-free experience with their data. By creating a central source of all information and services, the AIDAP system will completely enhance communication, student engagement and efficiency within the university.
