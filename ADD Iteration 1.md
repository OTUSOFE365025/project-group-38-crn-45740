# Step 1: Review Inputs

| **Category**                  | **Details** |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| **Design purpose**            | This is a greenfield system from a mature domain, and the purpose is to design the support for an AI-powered Digital Assistant platform (AIDAP). |
| **Primary functional requirements** | From the use cases, the primary ones were determined:<br><br>**UC-1:** Because it directly supports the core business<br><br>**UC-2:** Because it directly supports the core business<br><br>**UC-4:** Because it directly supports the core business<br><br>**UC-7:** Because of the technical issues related with QA-8, QA-9, and QA-10 |
| **Constraints**               | From the constraints, we decided to use all of them as drivers. |
| **Architectural concerns**    | From the architectural concerns, we decided to use all of them as drivers. |



# Step 2: Goals of the first Iteration
The goal of the first iteration is to define the overall architectural system, otherwise stated in CRN-1
While we are designing the general system, we should keep in mind some drivers along the way

QA-1: Performance<br><br>
QA-2: Availability<br><br>
QA-3: Scalability<br><br>
QA-4: Usability<br><br>
QA-5: Security<br><br>
QA-6: Portability<br><br>
QA-8: Modifiability<br><br>
CON-2: The system must be accessible via web, mobile, and voice assistants across major platforms. 

# Step 3: Choose One or More Elements of the System to Decompose
Since we are designing the overall system in the initial iteration, we will consider the system as a whole.

#Step 5: 

# Step 6: Sketch views and record design decisions
